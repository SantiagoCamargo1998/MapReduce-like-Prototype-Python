# MapReduce-like Executable Prototype

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a MapReduce-like executable prototype that mimics the functionality of the MapReduce/Hadoop framework. Designed to process large datasets efficiently, our prototype leverages multi-threading to simulate distributed data processing in a manner akin to how MapReduce operates within a Hadoop ecosystem.

## Features

- **Map Function**: Processes input data, partitioning it into key-value pairs for further analysis.
- **Reduce Function**: Aggregates the output from the Map function, summarizing data based on keys.
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Simulates distributed computing, enhancing data processing speed.
- **Data Shuffle and Sort**: Organizes data between the Map and Reduce phases to ensure accuracy in output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Any additional libraries or dependencies used in the project
